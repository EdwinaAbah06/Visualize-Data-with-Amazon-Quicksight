**Create Data visualization with amazon s3 and quicksight, working with a large dataset.**

**Overview**
This project demonstrates how to visualize data stored in **Amazon S3** using **Amazon QuickSight**. 
The dataset contains information about Amazon best-selling products, sourced from BrightData. 
This project aims to teach hands-on skills in cloud-based data storage, analytics, and visualization, valuable for cloud engineers and data professionals.  

**Objectives** 
  Store and manage data using Amazon S3.  
  Integrate S3 with QuickSight for data analysis and visualization.  
  Create interactive dashboards to derive insights from the dataset.  
  Equip learners with practical skills applicable in cloud and analytics roles.
